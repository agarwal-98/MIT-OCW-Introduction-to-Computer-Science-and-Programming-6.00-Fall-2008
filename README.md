# MIT-OCW-Introduction-to-Computer-Science-and-Programming-6.00-Fall-2008
 
The Introduction to Computer Science and Programming course ( MIT Course Number: 6.00) is provided by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is taught using Python programming language. This particular series of lecture was taught in Fall 2008, at the undergraduate level, by Professors Eric Grimson and John Guttag. 

This course is aimed at students with little or no programming experience and aims to provide students with an understanding of the role computation can play in solving problems.
This repository has been created to provide the worked solutions of all the problem sets that were due in this course.

The course was deeply engaging, joyfully challenging and each lecture and problem set stretched my mind to think computationally and solve problems by writing code.
